Export TikTok cookies (one-time) - instructions (options):

Option A - Browser extension (recommended quick)
1. Install a cookie export extension for Chrome/Edge/Firefox (e.g., 'EditThisCookie' or 'Get cookies.txt' or 'Cookie Quick Manager').
2. Open tiktok.com, log in to your account.
3. Use the extension to export cookies in JSON format. Save file as `tiktok_cookies.json` in the project folder.
4. If the extension exports a cookies.txt format, you can convert or use Playwright once to generate JSON.

Option B - Playwright (one-time, script included)
1. Run Playwright and log in manually, then use a small script to export cookies to JSON.
2. Example (run in Python after `python -m playwright install`):
   ```python
   from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
   import json

   with sync_playwright() as p:
       browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
       ctx = browser.new_context()
       page = ctx.new_page()
       page.goto('https://www.tiktok.com/login')
       input('Log in in the opened browser window, then press Enter here...')
       cookies = ctx.cookies()
       with open('tiktok_cookies.json','w',encoding='utf-8') as f:
           json.dump(cookies,f,indent=2)
       browser.close()
   ```
3. Move the generated `tiktok_cookies.json` into the project root.

Security note: keep `tiktok_cookies.json` private; it grants access to your logged-in session.
